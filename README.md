 Chrome extension to autoforward to old.reddit.com.  To stop auto-forwarding, turn off the extension.  This simple extension uses chrome manifest v3.

# Installation
 Since I have not released this on the extension store, installation can be done by visiting `chrome://extensions` in your browser.  Enable developer mode and load the unpacked extension by selecting the directory this code was downloaded to.
